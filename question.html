                    Equal (<span>=</span>) in JavaScript is used for assigning values to a variable.<br>
                    It is called as assignment operator.<br>
                    It does not return true or false.
                    <br>
                    Double equals (<span>==</span>) in JavaScript is used for comparing two variables,
                    but it ignores the datatype of variable.<br>
                    It is called as comparison operator.<br>
                    Return true if the two operands are equal.<br>
                    It will return false if the two operands are not equal.<br>
                    Triple equals (<span>===</span>) is used for comparing two variables,
                    but this operator also checks datatype and compares two values.<br>
                    It is also called as comparison operator.<br>
                    It returns true only if both values and data types are the same for the two variables.<br>

                    an <span>object</span> as a cabinet with signed files. Every piece of data is stored in its file by the key.<br>
                    It is easy to find a file by its name or add/remove a file.<br>
                    But quite often we find that we need an ordered collection,
                    where we have a 1st, a 2nd, a 3rd element and so on.
                    It is not convenient to use an object here, because it provides 
                    no methods to manage the order of elements. We can not insert a new property “between” the existing ones.
                    There exists a special data structure named <span>Array</span>, to store ordered collections.

                <span>Statically</span>-typed programming languages (<i>C,C++,...</i>) do type checking

            <p class="answer">
                An <span>expression</span> is any word or group of words or symbols that is a <strong>value</strong>. 
                In programming, an <span>expression</span> is a <strong>value</strong>, or anything that executes 
                and ends up being a <strong>value</strong>.<br>
                A <span>statement</span> is a group of expressions and/or statements that you design to carry out a
                task or an action.<br>
                <span>statement</span> are two-sided. they either do tasks or don't do them.<br> 
                Any statement that can return a value is automatically qualified to be used as an expression.
                That is why a function or class is a statement and also an expression in JavaScript.<br>
                Expressions can be assigned or used as operands, while statements can only be declared.<br>
                Statements create side effects to be useful, while expressions are values or execute to values<br>
                example of statement:<br><br>
                
                function add(){<br>
                do something;<br>
                return something;<br>
                }<br><br>
                
                and we call it as a statement<br><br>
                add() <br><br>
                example of expression:<br><br>
                let out = add();<br><br>

                The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:<br>
                Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.<br>
                Names must begin with a letter.<br>
                Names can also begin with $ and _ (it is not very common).<br>
                Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).<br>
                Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.<br>
                professional programmers often use JavaScript Dollar Sign ($) 
                as an alias for the main function in a JavaScript library and 
                use JavaScript Underscore (_) as an alias for "private (hidden)" variables.

                1. Named Functions: These are functions that are declared with a specific name 
                and can be executed by calling their name.<br>
                2. Anonymous Functions: These functions do not have a specific name and are 
                usually assigned to a variable or passed as arguments to other functions.<br>
                3. Arrow Functions: Introduced in ES6, arrow functions provide a concise
                syntax for writing anonymous functions.<br><br>

                1. Code Reusability : define once and reuse it multiple times<br>        
                2. Abstraction : Functions can abstract complex logic and provide a simplified interface<br>         
                3. Modularity : Breaking down code into smaller to making it easier to maintain, test, and debug.<br>
                4. Encapsulation : preventing conflicts with other parts of the code<br>
                5. Event Handling : used to handle events triggered by user interactions<br>
