                    Equal (<span>=</span>) in JavaScript is used for assigning values to a variable.<br>
                    It is called as assignment operator.<br>
                    It does not return true or false.
                    <br>
                    Double equals (<span>==</span>) in JavaScript is used for comparing two variables,
                    but it ignores the datatype of variable.<br>
                    It is called as comparison operator.<br>
                    Return true if the two operands are equal.<br>
                    It will return false if the two operands are not equal.<br>
                    Triple equals (<span>===</span>) is used for comparing two variables,
                    but this operator also checks datatype and compares two values.<br>
                    It is also called as comparison operator.<br>
                    It returns true only if both values and data types are the same for the two variables.<br>

            <p class="answer">                    
                <strong>Objects</strong> allow us to create a single entity that stores data items by key.<br>
                <strong>Objects</strong> are used for storing keyed collections.<br>
                <strong>Arrays</strong> allow us to gather data items into an ordered list.<br>
                <strong>Arrays</strong> are used for storing ordered collections.<br><br>
                <strong>Map</strong> is a collection of keyed data items, just like an <strong>Object</strong>.
                But the main difference is that <strong>Map</strong> allows keys of any type.<br>
                unlike <strong>Objects</strong>, keys are not converted to <strong>strings</strong>. Any type of key is possible.<br>
                Using <strong>Objects</strong> as keys is one of the most notable and important <strong>Map</strong> features.

                <strong>Statically</strong>-typed programming languages (<i>C,C++,...</i>) do type checking

            <p class="answer">
                An <strong>expression</strong> is any word or group of words or symbols that is a <strong>value</strong>. 
                In programming, an <strong>expression</strong> is a <strong>value</strong>, or anything that executes 
                and ends up being a <strong>value</strong>.<br>
                A <strong>statement</strong> is a group of expressions and/or statements that you design to carry out a
                task or an action.<br>
                <strong>statement</strong> are two-sided. they either do tasks or don't do them.<br> 
                Any statement that can return a value is automatically qualified to be used as an expression.
                That is why a function or class is a statement and also an expression in JavaScript.<br>
                Expressions can be assigned or used as operands, while statements can only be declared.<br>
                Statements create side effects to be useful, while expressions are values or execute to values<br>
                example of statement:<br><br>
                
                function add(){<br>
                do something;<br>
                return something;<br>
                }<br><br>
                
                and we call it as a statement====>  add(); <br>
                example of expression====>   let out = add();

            <p class="answer">
                The general rules for constructing names for variables (unique identifiers) are:<br>
                Names can contain letters, digits, underscores, and dollar signs.<br>
                Names must begin with a letter.<br>
                Names can also begin with $ and _ (it is not very common).<br>
                Names are case sensitive (y and Y are different variables).<br>
                Reserved words (like JavaScript keywords) cannot be used as names.<br>
                professional programmers often use JavaScript Dollar Sign ($) 
                as an alias for the main function in a JavaScript library and 
                use JavaScript Underscore (_) as an alias for "private (hidden)" variables.

                1. Named Functions: These are functions that are declared with a specific name 
                and can be executed by calling their name.<br>
                2. Anonymous Functions: These functions do not have a specific name and are 
                usually assigned to a variable or passed as arguments to other functions.<br>
                3. Arrow Functions: Introduced in ES6, arrow functions provide a concise
                syntax for writing anonymous functions.<br>

                3. Modularity : Breaking down code into smaller to making it easier to maintain, test, and debug.<br>
                4. Encapsulation : preventing conflicts with other parts of the code<br>

            <!-- Question -->
            <h1 class="question">
                Interpreter Vs Compiler?
            </h1>            
            <!-- Answer -->                
            <p class="answer">
                Programming languages like JavaScript, Python, Ruby use interpreters.<br>
                Programming languages like C, C++, Java use compilers.<br>                
                1-<strong>Execution Process</strong> : An interpreter reads the source code line 
                by line and executes it immediately. A compiler, on the other hand, 
                translates the entire source code into machine code or bytecode before execution.<br>
                2-<strong>Translation</strong> : Interpreters do not translate the entire source 
                code into machine code. They interpret and execute each line or instruction of 
                the source code individually. Compilers translate the entire source code into 
                machine code or bytecode before execution, enabling faster execution once 
                the translation is complete.<br>
                3-<strong>Efficiency</strong> : Interpreted programs tend to be slower 
                than compiled programs because they are executed directly, 
                without the performance optimizations that the compilation process provides.
                Compiled programs, once translated, are generally faster and more efficient.<br>
                4-<strong>Error Detection</strong> :  Interpreters detect errors on a 
                line-by-line basis. When an error is encountered, the execution of the
                program may halt, preventing further execution. In contrast, compilers 
                detect errors during the compilation phase and provide a list of all 
                errors and warnings before the program is executed.<br>
                5-<strong>Portability</strong> :  Interpreted programs are generally more 
                portable, as the interpreter can be run on different systems, provided the
                interpreter is available. Compiled programs are system-dependent, as 
                the compiled output is specific to the target system.<br>
                6-<strong>Debugging</strong> :  Interpreters typically offer more 
                interactive and immediate debugging capabilities, allowing developers 
                to step through the code and inspect variables during runtime. 
                Debugging compiled programs often involves using separate debugging 
                tools, which may be less immediate and require additional setup.<br>
