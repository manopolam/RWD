                    , <span>==</span> and <span>===</span> in JavaScript?</h1>

            <p class="answer">
                    Equal (<span>=</span>) in JavaScript is used for assigning values to a variable.<br>
                    It is called as assignment operator.<br>
                    It does not return true or false.
                    <br>
                    Double equals (<span>==</span>) in JavaScript is used for comparing two variables,
                    but it ignores the datatype of variable.<br>
                    It is called as comparison operator.<br>
                    Return true if the two operands are equal.<br>
                    It will return false if the two operands are not equal.<br>
                    Triple equals (<span>===</span>) is used for comparing two variables,
                    but this operator also checks datatype and compares two values.<br>
                    It is also called as comparison operator.<br>
                    It returns true only if both values and data types are the same for the two variables.<br>

            <!-- faq question -->
            <h1 class="question"><span>Objects</span> vs. <span>Arrays</span> ?</h1>
            
            <!-- faq answer -->                
            <p class="answer">                    
                    an <span>object</span> as a cabinet with signed files. Every piece of data is stored in its file by the key.<br>
                    It is easy to find a file by its name or add/remove a file.<br>
                    But quite often we find that we need an ordered collection,
                    where we have a 1st, a 2nd, a 3rd element and so on.
                    It is not convenient to use an object here, because it provides 
                    no methods to manage the order of elements. We can not insert a new property “between” the existing ones.
                    There exists a special data structure named <span>Array</span>, to store ordered collections.
